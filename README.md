This is a small "warm-up" demo made to test my tools and engine for this years js13k competition.

------


## Building

0. Make sure you have Git LFS installed, otherwise png files will be corrupted! (Note that `b.png` in `play` does not use LFS to get it working with Github pages)
1. Download Closure
2. Open `makefile` and change CLOSURE_PATH to the path of the jar (absolute or relative to the root)
3. Run `make pack`. It will create a minimized zip file.

## License

Feel free to use pieces of the code in your own project. No need to give credit, just don't claim that you wrote it by yourself.
